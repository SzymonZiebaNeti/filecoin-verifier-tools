# Allocation Plan [refer to the Rubric to see how this impacts your Notary score](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/172-sbd5qzdbSofvL_C5FHRyXEsTUpMiKspItygAVJA4/edit?usp=sharings)
## Concreteness of Allocation Plan 
### Allocation Strategy
How do you plan on allocating the DataCap requested above? Please describe your allocation strategy with as much specificity as you can. This includes the target amount per client and rate at which you'll allocate DataCap.
```
The purpose of datacap is to ensure that customers are storing real and valid data in right way. we need to have a rigorous review program on whether client have that much data and how to store this data to assess whether they should be granted credits.
The following Rubric will be the primary guideline we use when evaluating a client and determining their DataCap allocation.   
You can see it: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y9c3ERpzGSfzINl3FuuOI6owOStMIGSaUjyx9GUZG5M/edit#gid=0
And each client needs to fill out this complete questionnaire when applying datacap:
https://www.wjx.cn/vm/mz77Nzt.aspx
```

How do you plan on securing the DataCap to ensure your organization (and its delegated members) are the ones allocating the DataCap?
```
A hardware wallet will be used to store the keys associated with the DataCap allocation address securely. 
We set up a Filecoin working group dedicated to communicating with the community and managing account. There are 5 people in the working group. 
github account and hardware wallet account will be held by two people respectively
```

### Client Due Diligence
How will you vet the clients that are applying for DataCap? What questions will you ask to ensure your trust is placed well and that clients can properly handle the DataCap you intend to allocate to them? 
```
All clients’ applications must be strictly reviewed. The more datacap applied, the stricter the review. Referring to the practice of filecoin notary application, the datacap is determined based on the client’s background investigation. It mainly involves the following:
Establishment time/Registered Capital/ Organization size and regions/Individual Reputation/Miner Decentralization/Diversity of Distribution Region/Track Record
```

What processes will you employ when granting additional DataCap to a client that has previously been verified? This includes confirming that the client is not improperly using the DataCap they were previously granted, i.e., making deals with a single SP entity.
```
Through the filplus.info website it is easy to display if a client deals with a miner. I will check regularly. 
```

### Bookkeeping Plan
Do you plan on conducting all your allocation decisions in public (e.g. Github repo), private (e.g. over email, Telegram, etc), or both? 
```
All my allocation decisions will be conducted publicly in the Github repository ( https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-client-onboarding )
```

Where do you plan on keeping a publicly accessible record of all your allocation decisions?
```
I will make a repo on github to record of all your allocation decisions.
```
