# Allocation Plan
## Concreteness of Allocation Plan
### Allocation Strategy
How do you plan on allocating the DataCap requested above? Please describe your allocation strategy with as much specificity as you can. This includes the target amount per client and rate at which you'll allocate DataCap.
```
We will use the assessment model to score clients, according to the standard scale of 1 to 5 to evaluate and assign their DataCap needs.
We have made a scoring table for clients reviews :
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17h4X9lvE4Sdr47mHiwAJzYyXwtW743KV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118364709155675277156&rtpof=true&sd=true

We will assign DataCap to the clients who can provide real information of their company and ensure that the data is publicly available. We have a series of rules to determine the true and valid identity information of clients：

1.We will browse the client's official website to understand the basic information of the their organization.

2.We will require the clients to provide verifiable information such as the organization's business registration and establishment documents by mail

3. We will conduct a review of the clients company's data storage content, and we prioritize the clients who store high-value data.

We conduct our internal review process through 4 stages
1. The primary reviewer will conduct a basic review of the application submitted by the client. The applicant's data storage must be open and valid data, and there are real storage requirements.
2. According to the results of the basic review, the junior reviewers will submit the allocation process to the intermediate reviewers, and the intermediate reviewers will give a score based on the content of the evaluation model.
3. According to the scoring results of the intermediate reviewers, the senior reviewers will further conduct a detailed investigation of the business ecology of the company, as well as verify the true information of the applicant and the company, and make a final decision and signature.
4. After the decision of the senior reviewer is approved and signed, the DataCap will be assigned a certain amount to the client. If not passed, we will inform the client of the review result.
```

How do you plan on securing the DataCap to ensure your organization (and its delegated members) are the ones allocating the DataCap?
```
We use a hardware wallet to store the private key to ensure the security of the account. After being reviewed by our internal decision makers, the data caps will be allocated to applicants by those who have the right to execute the hardware wallet.
```

### Client Due Diligence
How will you vet the clients that are applying for DataCap? What questions will you ask to ensure your trust is placed well and that clients can properly handle the DataCap you intend to allocate to them?
```
In order to ensure the authenticity of the information and reputation of our clients, we will verify the online and physical identity and reputation of our clients through the following content.


Online information:
1.Review third-party public data provided by clients, such as Twitter-type social media accounts. We will observe the activity of the account, and the activity of the Github usage period.
2.Browse clients and their company's official website and review the company's history, news, ecology and products.
3.Make a query on the enterprise information website in the clients country/region
4.Use official email to confirm whether the clients is applying for Data Cap, and confirm their identity information and job information.

Entity Information:
1.We will require our clients to provide business registration, establishment documents, public registration information and relevant certificates.
2.Will require our clients to provide government-issued ID or passport information.
3.Our clients need to provide us with sample data they want to store, and we will check that their data is valid and publicly available.
4.For the privacy of the clients, we will recommend that our clients send entity information by email.

We will require our clients to promise not to have any violations. We will give a reminder if there is any of the following behaviors. The clients with serious violations will be blacklisted by us.

1.We require our clients to comply with the laws of the country and region where they are located, and shall not have any violations of laws and regulations.
2.We require our clients to comply with Filecoin's community regulation..
3.Our clients must ensure the stored content is legal, valid and insensitive.
```

What processes will you employ when granting additional DataCap to a client that has previously been verified? This includes confirming that the client is not improperly using the DataCap they were previously granted, i.e., making deals with a single SP entity.
```
We require clients to disclose transaction information. After the clients obtain Data Cap, we will continue to follow up their transaction information every week. Once the clients are found to have violation operations, we will give a reminder. If the violation circumstances are serious, we will disclose the violating operations of this client in the public community, and pulled into the blacklist to reject the future application. If the client refuses to disclose, we will deny his application.
```

### Bookkeeping Plan
