## Project details

Share a brief history of your project and organization.
```
BigData Exchange is a Filecoin data storage marketplace that connects clients with valuable public data and storage providers with storage capacity. Headquartered and operated in Singapore, there are currently over 30 people globally in the core team.
With the current demand for Filecoin plus deals, there are several benefits that BigData Exchange brings to the Filecoin network:

- An innovative storage platform to incentivize more people to source, migrate, and store valuable public data on Filecoin
- A transparent marketplace to connect Fil+ clients and storage providers, which adds visibility to the SP selection process and prevents potential self-dealing activities
- An index of public data stored on Filecoin, which paves the way to a vibrant retrieval and service market for Fil+ deals

The goal is not to profit from DataCap. For any proceeds, we will donate them to data preservation organization or use them to fund/incentivize activities that aim to onboard more useful data storage on Filecoin.

## Use-case details

Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin
```
Smithsonian Open Access is a public open dataset available in AWS S3. The Smithsonian’s mission is the "increase and diffusion of knowledge" and has been collecting since 1846. The Smithsonian, through its efforts to digitize its multidisciplinary collections, has created millions of digital assets and related metadata describing the collection objects.
```

Where was the data in this dataset sourced from?
```
On February 25th, 2020, the Smithsonian released over 2.8 million CC0 interdisciplinary 2-D and 3-D images, related metadata, and additionally, research data from researches across the Smithsonian. The 2.8 million "open access" collections are a subset of the Smithsonian’s 155 million objects, 2.1 million library volumes and 156,000 cubic feet of archival collections held in 19 museums, 9 research centers, libraries, archives and the National Zoo. Digitization of collections is ongoing.
```

Can you share a sample of the data? A link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this. 
```
[Please answer here.](https://registry.opendata.aws/smithsonian-open-access/)
```
        
Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the Network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data).
```
Yes
```

What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data?
```
It will serve as a public data copy on the decentralized web that is open for anybody’s access. The retrieval frequency for this data will depend on user demand.
```

For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin?
```
18 months
```


## DataCap allocation plan

In which geographies (countries, regions) do you plan on making storage deals?
```
We do not have regional preference currently, but our ideal goal would be to make sure that users from all over the world can access this valuable open data.
```

How will you be distributing your data to storage providers? Is there an offline data transfer process?
```
We will provide an online URL for the storage providers to download CAR files.
```

How do you plan on choosing the storage providers with whom you will be making deals? This should include a plan to ensure the data is retrievable in the future both by you and others.
```
We will list the dataset described above on BigData Exchange and await bids from storage providers. Once the auction period ends, we will check SP’s bidding price, reputation, geographic information, sealing speed, etc. to select the final storage providers to work with.
```

How will you be distributing deals across storage providers?
```
The dataset will have 3 replicas and we are planning to distribute them to different storage providers with up to 20% each.
```

Do you have the resources/funding to start making deals as soon as you receive DataCap? What support from the community would help you onboard onto Filecoin?
```
We will use BigData Exchange to find the right storage providers. For each allocation, we will create auctions with an auction period to be 7 days. When the auction ends, we will be ready to make deals with storage providers directly. The goal is not to profit from DataCap. For any proceeds, we will donate them to data preservation organization or use them to fund/incentivize activities that aim to onboard more useful data storage on Filecoin.
